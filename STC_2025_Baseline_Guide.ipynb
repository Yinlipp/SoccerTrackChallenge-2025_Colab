        "This baseline applies the Deep-EIoU multi-object tracking (MOT) github official code to the soccer match videos provided by the SoccerTrack Challenge 2025. The tracking results are evaluated using the ground truth annotations and the HOTA metric. Additionally, visualizations of the MOT output are provided for qualitative analysis.\n",
